# Tartarys Whitepaper

This repository contains the public release of **Tartarys Whitepaper v1**.

Tartarys proposes a community-governed framework for recognizing and preserving
cultural and intellectual value without coercive enforcement, centralized
ownership, or mandatory financial barriers.

The document introduces:
- a non-coercive ethical signaling layer (ESSP),
- a public notice and memory mechanism (Y–B Model),
- and a cultural signal unit (CST / Peng) used for voluntary recognition.

This repository serves as:
- an immutable public timestamp of publication,
- a reference point for future versions,
- and a neutral archive for open examination.

No promises are made.
No participation is required.
No authority is claimed.

Readers are invited to witness, reflect, and propose improvements
through transparent discussion.

## Conceptual Background

Tartarys is built on the recognition that trust, legitimacy, and order can emerge organically within human networks — without coercion, central enforcement, or imposed authority.

The project draws inspiration from network-based models of social organization, where reputation, visibility, and collective acknowledgment act as stabilizing forces. In such systems, ethical behavior scales naturally with community size, and misconduct is addressed through transparency rather than force.

Tartarys applies this network logic to cultural, spiritual, and intellectual value preservation in a decentralized, community-governed framework.
