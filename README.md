# Tartarys Whitepaper

This repository contains the public release of **Tartarys Whitepaper v1**.

Tartarys proposes a community-governed framework for recognizing and preserving
cultural and intellectual value without coercive enforcement, centralized
ownership, or mandatory financial barriers.

The document introduces:
- a non-coercive ethical signaling layer (ESSP),
- a public notice and memory mechanism (Y–B Model),
- and a cultural signal unit (CST / Peng) used for voluntary recognition.

This repository serves as:
- an immutable public timestamp of publication,
- a reference point for future versions,
- and a neutral archive for open examination.

No promises are made.
No participation is required.
No authority is claimed.

Readers are invited to witness, reflect, and propose improvements
through transparent discussion.
